# 407Project
EE407 Project for DC motor speed and alignment control

We aim to make a contribution to the final year project by designing the control unit of the dc motors of an autonomous
robot trying to detect an object and approach it with maximum accuracy. We will be using the camera information received 
from one microcontroller that is raspberry pi and  distance information from another sensor via another controller that is Arduino 
and use Arduino as the controller unit for the motors. The task will depend on suppliying the duty cycle of the motors with a feedback 
control.
